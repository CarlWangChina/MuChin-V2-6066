This directory contains the code for calculating Intent Fidelity metrics, specifically Semantic Audio Alignment (SAA) and Acoustic Reference Alignment (ARA), as discussed in our research.

The weights are located in the "Checkpoints-for-SAA-ARA" folder at https://huggingface.co/karl-wang/ama-prof-divi/tree/main/models. After downloading, place them in the "GitHub/MuChin-V2-6066/Code-for-Experiment/Metrics/intent_fidelity_metrics/checkpoints-for-SAA-ARA" directory to run the code.
